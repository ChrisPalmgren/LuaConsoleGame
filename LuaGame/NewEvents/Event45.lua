print("The car and your partner are still above you, but you also see...\nabove him...\na tear in the dark void with a soft humming coming through it.\nYou drift up to the car and lock eyes with your partner.\nHe gives you a comforting nod and points up at the tear teasingly.\nYou finally did it, honey. You let go and I am so proud of you.\nTime to move on to THAT, he says and points up. The humming from the tear continues its soothing tunes, calling you.\nYou drift towards it, still hesitant.\nFrom below you hear your partner shout at you:\nGo on now! Do it, slowpoke!\nHis words make you smile wider than you have ever done before....\nAnd you move on.\n\n")
