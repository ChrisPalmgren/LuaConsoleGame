Event42 = "You leap with all of your might and as you hit the rough ground, there is pain for a split second and then darkness covers your eyes.\nAfter what feels like infinity, the darkness turns into a whirlwind of purple and red and you are in the center of it. Swallowed by the whirlwind, you see.... yourself?\nThousands upon thousands of copies of you are spireling around you rapidly; chaotically. There is a flash, and then another.\nAnd anothER.\nAnd anOTHER.\nAND ANOTHER.\n\nSome otherwordly force draws you out of the quiet center and into the red and purple vortex of yous' that tumbles around you.\nNow you are one of them and as much as you strugle to get back into the center of the whirlwind, you are stuck here.\nAfter a moment of struggle, you succumb.\nIt's over. It's all over now.\n"
